# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Module 16: Statistics and R

## Background

We've been tasked with analizing production data for AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar. The prototype is currently suffering from production issues that have prevented the manufacturing team from progressing. In order to provide meaningful insights, we'll utilize R Studio to perform a statistical analysis on the protogype data. 

Outline of Statistical Analysis: 
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

This new assignment consists of three technical analysis parts and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:
- Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Part 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Part 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
- Part 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
